Hello, and welcome!

I'm Brian Stewart, a craftsman, a builder,
in pursuit of excellence in all I do.

My journey to the present day is a winding one, but here I am.

### I love building

My love of craftsmanship showed itself early.
For my fifth birthday, I was given a bucket of Legos.
After that, I don't much remember playing with other toys.
I wanted to be a "Lego Designer" when I grew up.
I kinda still do.

### I love learning

Around twelve years old I got a model rocket kit.
After a few flights, an idea started taking shape:
Could I angle the rocket into the wind so it would land back where it was launched?
To make the calculations, I taught myself physics, trigonometry, spreadsheets.
I wrote up my findings and ended up at the Florida state science fair.
I love to explore new things.

### I love people

I love meeting people, communicating, sharing life together.
It's all to easy to be anonymous online, where communication is cheap.
But know that what I care about is you, the person.
Let's talk face-to-face over a coffee or a beer sometime.

### I love my family

I love my wonderful wife, my best friend, my teammate, Amy.
She helps me so much.
I love our little son Paxton Wallace, my young warrior poet.
They are the reason I work so hard.

### I love Jesus

Jesus restored my broken life.
Now I walk with him.
I'm awed by the beauty and elegance of the Creator's craftsmanship.
He is my inspiration.
